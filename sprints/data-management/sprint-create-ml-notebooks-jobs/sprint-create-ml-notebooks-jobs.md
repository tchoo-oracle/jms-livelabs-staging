5. In the **Start Date** field, click the date-time editor to set the date and time for your job to commence. You can select the current date or any future date and time. Based on the selected date and time, the next run date is computed.

6. Select **Repeat Frequency** if needed and enter the number of times for the job to run, and select **Days** to set the repeat frequency and settings. You can set the frequency in minutes, hours, days, weeks, and months.

7. Expand **Advanced Settings**, and specify the following settings:

	* **Maximum Number of Runs:** Select a number to specify the maximum number of times the job must run before it is stopped. When the job reaches the maximum run limit, it will stop.

	* **Timeout in Minutes:** Select a number to specify the maximum amount of time a job should be allowed to run.

	* **Maximum Failures Allowed:** Select a number to specify the maximum number of times a job can fail on consecutive scheduled runs. When the maximum number of failures is reached, the next run date column in the Jobs UI will show an empty value to indicate the job is no longer scheduled to run. The Status column may show the status as `Failed`.

		> **Note:** Select **Automatic Retry** if you do not wish to specify the maximum failures allowed manually.
