# Introduction

## About Java Management Service

Java Management Service (JMS) is a reporting and management infrastructure integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Platform services to observe and manage your use of Java SE (on-premises or in the Cloud).

Watch the video below for an introduction to Java Management Service and a brief demo.

As a customer, you can:

* Use insights from JMS to optimize your workloads across your enterprise (desktop, server, cloud); and
* Protect your Java SE investments by identifying outdated Java installations and unauthorized applications.

JMS helps systems administrators to answer questions such as:

* What are all the versions of Java I have running in development and production?
* Which vendors are providing the Java installations in my environment?
* Are my applications using their intended Java installations?
* Are unauthorized applications running?
* How many outdated Java installations do I have?

As the stewards of Java, Oracle can provide answers to these questions. Oracle uniquely leverages its expertise to gain critical insights into Java application behavior, compliance, and performance.

## About this Workshop

 This workshop will walk you through the process of setting up and using various Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services for use with Java Management Service (JMS) on OCI. It will first walk you through the set up and use of the OCI Command Line Interface (CLI) to access JMS APIs. It will then walk you through the set up and use of JMS Software Development Kits (SDKs) and Postman to use the JMS APIs. Next, you will learn how to use scripts to generate reports for JMS Fleets. Later, you will learn how to set up a Site-to-Site Virtual Private Network (VPN) to secure data transmission between OCI networks and your on-premises hosts. Finally, you will learn how to set up alarms for JMS using the OCI Monitoring Service.

*Estimated Time:* 100 minutes
