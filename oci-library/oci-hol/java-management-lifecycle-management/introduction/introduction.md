# Introduction

## About the Lifecycle Management

Lifecycle Management (LCM) is a part of JMS reporting and management infrastructure. JMS enables Users to observe and manage the use of Java SE (on-premises or in the Cloud) by utilizing LCM operations such as Removing or Updating Java Runtimes.

As a customer, you can:
  * View and Identify the Java Runtimes.
  * Update or Upgrade the outdated Java Runtimes.
  * Remove unwanted Java Runtimes.
  * View and understand various status and logs related to LCM work requests.

## About this Workshop 

Java Management Service (JMS) is a reporting and management infrastructure integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Platform services to observe and manage your use of Java SE (on-premises or in the Cloud). Java Runtime can be viewed and identified in fleet after successful JMS setup on Host. Further, these Java Runtimes can be managed by performing various Lifecycle Management (LCM) operations.

In order to perform these LCM operations almost no or minor configuration changes are required. This workshop will walk you through the steps to verify the installation of OCA (Oracle Cloud Agent) and required plugins on OCI computer instances, followed by configuration changes in non-OCI hosts. Next, you will learn how to review and identify the Java Runtimes in OCI console, this is where you will perform most of the LCM operations. Later, you will learn how to remove a Java Runtime using OCI console and cancel or view a work request. You will also get to view status and logs related to delete work requests. Finally, the workshop will show you how to view and monitor Lifecycle Management requests.

<em>Estimated Time:</em> XX minutes
