### OCI Object Storage

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Object Storage service is an Internet-scale, high-performance storage platform that offers reliable and cost-efficient data durability. The Object Storage service can store an unlimited amount of unstructured data of any content type, including analytic data and rich content, like images and videos.
