# Provision Oracle Integration

> **Note:** This step is required **only** if have have not yet provisioned an Oracle Integration instance. 

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the process of provisioning an instance of Oracle Integration, assuming you don't already have one available to you. If you do, you can skip this lab and move on to the next one.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Provision Integration Instance.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle account.

### Background

If you just created a new Cloud account following the instructions in Getting Started, you must wait up to 30 minutes before you attempt to create an instance of Oracle Integration. (It could take anywhere between 10 and 30 minutes for a new user account to be fully provisioned) If you already have a Cloud account, you don't need to wait. Either way, make sure you've signed in to the Oracle Cloud as an Oracle Identity Cloud Service user before proceeding.

## Task 1: Create an Instance of Oracle Integration

1. On the Oracle Cloud Get Started page, select the region in the upper right where you want to create your Oracle Integration instance. Once created, instances are visible only in the region in which they were created.

2. On the Oracle Cloud Get Started page, click the menu in the upper left corner to display the services you can provision.

4. From the Compartment list, click through the hierarchy of compartments and select the one in which to create the instance. You may need to expand the + icon to find the compartment to use. Compartments can contain other compartments. It may take several minutes for the new compartment to appear after the policy has been created.
