## Introduction

The following hands-on workshop will walk users through connecting **Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)** to **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)**, getting immediate valuable insight out of your data, scaling up ADB database to optimize OAC performance, deepening analysis by mashing-up additional data and leveraging OAC interactive visualization features.


**Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)** delivers a self-driving, self-securing, self-repairing database service that can instantly scale to meet demands. The service supports two workload types:

- **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)** provides an autonomous warehousing environment, associated with fast query performance

- **Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP)** provides an autonomous online transaction processing and mixed workload environment  
- **Oracle Autonomous JSON Database** is Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing, but designed for developing NoSQL-style applications that use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents  
-  **Oracle Autonomous APEX Database** provides a preconfigured, fully managed and secured environment to both build and deploy world-class data-centric applications

For the purpose of this workshop, we will use **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)** so all the steps will be related to this database service.

**Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)** is a scalable and secure public cloud service that provides a full set of capabilities to explore and perform collaborative analytics for you, your workgroup, and your enterprise.

With **Oracle Analytics Cloud**, you get flexible service management capabilities, including fast setup, easy scaling and patching, and automated lifecycle management.

To run the workshop, you will need an [_Oracle Cloud Free Tier Account_](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) or a Paid account. You'll provision an ADW instance and a an OAC instance. This pre-requisite guide will take you step-by-step through how to get the account and set the instance up, to be ready to start the workshop.

  > **Note:** If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account. You will not be able to conduct Free Tier workshops unless the Always Free environment is available. **[Click here for the Free Tier FAQ page.](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/faq.html)**
