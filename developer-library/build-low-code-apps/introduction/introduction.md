# Introduction

## Modernize and Extend Legacy Apps in the Oracle Cloud

Learn how to modernize or extend legacy applications into a cloud-native microservice-based development framework leveraging the Oracle Cloud. During this sales play, customers will follow the journey of 7 personas inside a fictitious company. Our day will begin with a first-hand look from the perspective of Richard, the CTO, as he explains the frustration with the speed at which the company is able to go to market with new services, features, promotions, and functionality. Richard hopes to leverage micro-services to create a highly scalable architecture that will allow new services and features to be deployed at the speed the business is demanding. Next we will follow Jim, Operation Engineer, as he provisions the necessary Oracle Cloud Services such as OCI Compartments, Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) databases, Kubernetes Cluster and Developer Cloud (DevCS) Service.  We will then follow Gerald, our DBA. Gerald will show how to set up and explore Oracleâ€™s autonomous database cloud service (ATP). Christian, Java Developer, leverages DevCS to set up CI/CD pipeline to build and deploy applications. Next we will follow DevOps Engineer, Derek, as he explores Kubernetes. You will then follow Sarika, a JavaScript Developer as she learns to leverage the power of Visual Builder to construct a mobile app leveraging the product catalog micro-services.  Finally, there's Steve, from the Finance department.  He is responsible for Sales Forecast Projections and will build an APEX application in ATP and will leverage DevCS to clone an APEX application.
