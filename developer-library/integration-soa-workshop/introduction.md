# Introduction

## Integration and Orchestration

### Overview

This Oracle SOA workshop demonstrates an implementation of business use case by walking through application development of validating payment processing for an online ordering system. The ordering system will integrate with a mobile application. The composite SOA app built must be able to support access through RESTful APIs.

In the advanced workshop, the order processing would also integrate with systems and apps from the packaging department to do ship orders with preferred shipping providers based on the type of shipping service (2 day, 5-7 day shipping, and so on).

The bulk fulfillment process must run according to a predefined pick-up schedule. Upon fulfillment processing and orders being sent to the packaging department, a message must be communicated to the customer (either bulk or on-demand).

### Objectives

* Introducing SOA development tool, JDeveloper 12c
* Design SOA composite application using JDeveloper as an IDE
* Develop service orchestration in SOA, JDeveloper 12c
* Deploy the composite application on the embedded SOA-Weblogic in JDeveloper

Estimated Total Workshop Time: 3 Hours

*{Note: For this lab, it assumes you have accessed to JDeveloper12c environment, which can be run on Linux instance on OCI.}*
