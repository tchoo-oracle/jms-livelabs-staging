# Oracle SOA suite

## What is SOA?
SOA, Service Orientated Architecture. It is a style of an enterprise IT design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. A SOA service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. These services are representation of multiple applications that each delivers specific business functions. SOA is also an architectural approach to integration and orchestrating these service. Together, the services perform end to end business flow task. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies

### About Oracle SOA suite

Critical business services, such as customer, financial, ordering information, and others that were previously accessible only in packaged application user interfaces can now be rapidly repurpose for digital-enabled channel such as: smart phone and tablets.

Estimated lab time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

- Introducing SOA development tool, JDeveloper 12c
- Build SOA composite application using JDeveloper
- Design service orchestration using the composite app
- Deploy the composite application to the embedded Weblogic in JDeveloper
  
<!-- ## How to Run the Labs
To run this lab as per instruction provided during live session led by an instructor. 

For participating these labs, you've been granted access to a compute resource via an email invitation or an event code. Please check your inbox email to find details regarding access to a compute resource on Oracle Cloud infrastructure (OCI). -->

<!--Below are steps on how to sign-up for either an Oracle cloud service o. The always free Oracle Compute on OCI is ideal for learning about the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This service can readily be upgraded to a paid service as necessary. 

Detail can be found on https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/FreeTier/resourceref.htm 


## SOA deployment on Cloud or Data Center
### **Option 1**: To deploy SOA on Oracle Cloud - OCI, use SOA on Oracle Marketplace
