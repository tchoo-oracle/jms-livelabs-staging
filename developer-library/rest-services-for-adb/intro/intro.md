# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop will walk you through creating a REST service using Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) on an Autonomous Database. You will start by creating an application user whom you will use throughout all the lab steps. Once created, we will load data and create a table in our database. Using the same UI, we will REST enable that table so that endpoints are created for all major operations (create, update, query, delete). Lastly, we will use OAuth to secure the REST service endpoints. This lab will be done entirely from the Database Actions UI that is provided with all Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) installs and with the Autonomous Database in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour

### About Oracle REST Data Services

Oracle REST Data Services (ORDS) bridges HTTPS and your Oracle Database. A mid-tier Java application, ORDS, provides a Database Management REST API, a web based SQL, JSON and REST workshops, a PL/SQL Gateway, SODA for REST, and the ability to publish RESTful Web Services for interacting with the data and stored procedures in your Oracle Database.

The Java Enterprise Edition implementation offers increased functionality including a command line based configuration, enhanced security, file caching, and RESTful web services. Oracle REST Data Services also provides increased flexibility by supporting deployments using Oracle WebLogic Server, Apache Tomcat, and a standalone mode. Oracle REST Data Services further simplifies the deployment process because there is no Oracle home required, as connectivity is provided using an embedded JDBC driver.

Watch the video below for a comprehensive overview of REST and how ORDS provides what you need to deliver RESTful Services for your Oracle Database.
