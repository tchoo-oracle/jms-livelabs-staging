## About the Oracle Database 23c New Features Workshop

This workshop lets you try out new features in Oracle Database 23c. All the labs are independent of each other, so you don't need to do them in any particular order. If needed, a lab starts with instructions on how to prepare your environment, and ends with instructions on how to restore your environment back to its original state. For most lab steps, you enter a command in the terminal window. For database actions, you use SQL*Plus.

> **Note**: Currently, this workshop is not supported in an Always Free environment.
