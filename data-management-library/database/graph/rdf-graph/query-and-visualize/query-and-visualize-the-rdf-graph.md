# Lab 3: Querying and Visualizing the RDF Graph

## Introduction

You can analyze, query, and visualize the RDF graph built from the Moviestream RDF file in a notebook paragraph. This section explains the steps to be followed to create a notebook in Graph Studio and to get started executing SPARQL queries on the RDF graph.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives
- Create a Notebook in Graph Studio
- Use RDF Interpreter in Notebook paragraph
- Query and Analyze the RDF Graph

### Prerequisites
  This lab assumes you have:
  - Oracle Cloud Account
  - Provisioned Autonomous Database-Shared instance
  - A database user with the correct roles and privileges for working with Graph Studio. That is, successful completion of Lab 1 & 2 of the [Get Started with Graph Studio workshop](https://oracle.github.io/learning-library/data-management-library/autonomous-database/shared/adb-graph/workshops/freetier/index.html?lab=lab-1-create-graph-user)


## **Task 1:** Create a Notebook in Graph Studio

You can perform the following steps to create a notebook in Graph Studio.

1. Log in to Graph Studio with user credentials.

  ![This screen prompts for log-in credentials](./images/login-credential.png)

2. Go to the Notebooks page and click the Create button.

  ![Shows navigation to create notebook](./images/create-notebook.png)

3. Enter the notebook Name. Optionally, you can enter Description and Tags. Click Create.

  ![Demonstrates how to create a new name for a notebook](./images/name-notebook.png)

## **Task 2:** Use RDF Interpreter in Notebook Paragraph

For a newly created notebook, the notebook page is displayed with an empty paragraph. You can run a notebook paragraph using one of the following supported interpreters:

- Markdown
- Java
- Python
- PGQL

To create additional paragraphs, mouse over the bottom of an existing paragraph and click the required interpreter icon. The desired paragraph opens.

Note: In this Graph Studio LA Release, the RDF interpreter icon is hidden. However, you can invoke the RDF interpreter by executing the paragraph with the %sparql-rdf directive at the beginning of the paragraph. The icon will be available in the Graph Studio GA Release.

A Markdown paragraph begins with %md and an RDF paragraph begins with %sparql- rdf. See Available Notebook Interpreters for more information on the other Graph Studio Interpreters.
You can execute a paragraph by clicking the Run Paragraph icon, which is shown highlighted in the preceding figure. Graph Studio will start to build the interpreter environment in the background if there is not one created. Paragraphs will run after the environment creation. See Inspect the Environment for more information to view the interpreter memory configuration.

## **Task 3:** Generate an Access Token from the OCI Console

This section gives an introduction to the SPARQL 1.1 query language through a series of example queries using the MOVIESTREAM RDF graph.

If you just have one RDF graph (MOVIESTREAM) in your account, then you can directly execute the queries shown in the examples in the following sections. The graph is automatically selected.

But, if your account has more than one RDF graph, a selection box is displayed when you execute the first SPARQL query in the notebook as shown:

  ![Shows an example of a selection box](./images/selection-box.png)

Section 1:  Example Query 1: Using Graph Patterns in a SPARQL Query

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 1
    Query 1 shows a simple SPARQL query to find the title and revenue
    in USD of all movies starring Kevin Bacon.

    Query 1 starts with namespace prefix definitions, which allow you
    to write URIs in a short form in other parts of the query. For
    example, `ms:actor` is short for
    `<http://www.example.com/moviestream/actor>`.  

    The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables to project from the
    query, and the `WHERE` clause specifies three triple patterns
    enclosed within curly braces. A '.' is used as a separator
    between triple patterns. A shared variable between triple
    patterns serves as an implicit join condition.  

    In this query, `?actor` appears in the first and second triple
    patterns and `?movie` appears in the first, third and fourth
    triple patterns, which means that for three triples to match this
    pattern, the object of the first triple must be equal to the
    subject of the second triple, and the subject of the first triple
    must be equal to the subject of the third and fourth triples. A
    set of triple patterns within curly braces is called a graph
    pattern. A single SPARQL query may contain several graph
    patterns, and graph patterns can be nested inside other graph
    patterns.</copy>
    ```

2. Execute the following in an RDF paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%sparql-rdf

    PREFIX  rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    PREFIX  xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
    PREFIX   ms: <http://www.example.com/moviestream/>

      SELECT ?title ?revenue
      WHERE {
        ?movie ms:actor ?actor .
        ?actor ms:name "Kevin Bacon" .
        ?movie ms:title ?title .
        ?movie ms:grossInUSD ?revenue
      }</copy>
    ```

Section 2: Example Query 2: Executing a Concise SPARQL Query Using Shortcuts

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 2
    Query 2 finds distinct genres of movies starring Keanu Reeves in ascending order.

    #### Using Shortcuts
    SPARQL syntax allows several shortcuts for writing common query patterns more concisely.
    A sequence of triple patterns that repeat the same subject can be written by specifying the first triple in the normal way followed by a semicolon rather than a period, and subsequent triples can be written as predicate object pairs separated by semicolons, with a period following the last triple in the sequence.</copy>
    ```

The query output is as shown:

  ![Finds distinct genres of movies starring Keanu Reeves in ascending order](./images/query2.png)

2. Execute the following in an RDF paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%sparql-rdf

Section 3: Example Query 3: Using Grouping and Aggregation in a SPARQL Query

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 3
    Query 3 finds genres of movies starring Tom Hanks, the number of movies of each genre, and the average gross revenue of movies in each genre.

    #### Grouping and Aggregation
    Grouping and aggregation in SPARQL is very similar to grouping and aggregation in SQL. SPARQL provides the following built-in aggregates: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`, `GROUP_CONCAT`, and `SAMPLE`. Grouping is specified with `GROUP BY` and conditions on groups are specified with a `HAVING` clause. In SPARQL, expressions in the `SELECT` clause must be surrounded by parenthesis and given a variable name as a alias, for example `(COUNT(*) AS ?cnt)`, and elements in the `SELECT` clause are separated by blank space instead of with a comma. Expressions are also allowed in `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` and must be surrounded by parenthesis, with blank space used as a separator.</copy>
    ```

The query output is as shown:

  ![Finds Genres of movies starring Tom Hanks, the number of movies of each genre, and the average gross revenue in each genre](./images/query3.png)

        ?movie ms:actor/ms:name "Tom Hanks" ;
        ms:genre/ms:genreName ?gname ;
        ms:grossInUSD ?revenue .
      }
      GROUP BY ?gname
      ORDER BY DESC(?avg_revenue)</copy>

Section 4: Example Query 4: Using LIMIT Clause in a SPARQL Query

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 4
    Query 4 finds the 10  movies with the most actors.

    #### LIMIT and OFFSET Clause
    Note the use of a `LIMIT` clause to restrict the total number of results to 10. SPARQL also supports an `OFFSET` clause to skip a number of solutions before returning query results.</copy>
    ```

The query output is as shown:

Section 5:  Example Query 5: Using Dataset Descriptions in a SPARQL Query

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 5
    Query 5 shows the RDF properties defined in this dataset and their counts.

    #### Dataset Descriptions

Section 7: Using FILTER Clause in a SPARQL Query

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 7
    Query 7 finds movies with Matt Damon that are more than 150 minutes long.

    #### Filtering Solutions
    SPARQL uses the `FILTER` keyword to specify filter conditions on query elements. SPARQL `FILTER` clauses are analagous to SQL `WHERE` clauses. The usual logical comparison operators, boolean connectors, and numeric operators can be used. Note that SPARQL uses `&&` instead of the keyword `AND` and `||` instead of the keyword `OR`. SPARQL also provides several built-in string, numeric, date, time, and hash functions in addition to RDF-specific functions. See the SPARQL 1.1 specification for a complete list.</copy>

Section 8: Example Query 8: Using OPTIONAL Clause in a SPARQL Query

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 8
    Query 8 finds movies with Jack Nicholson and optionally their awards.

    ## Optional Matches
    SPARQL uses the `OPTIONAL` keyword to denote that a graph pattern should be matched in a best effort fashion. That is, if there is a result for the optional pattern, then return it, otherwise return NULL or no value. This feature is particularly useful for RDF data due to its schemaless nature and tolerance for irregular data. Resources of the same type in RDF graphs will often have different properties, and `OPTIONAL` allows us to match patterns when they exist but not exclude results when those patterns are not matched. If there are multiple triple patterns inside an `OPTIONAL` clause, then all of those triple patterns must match for the `OPTIONAL` pattern to return a result. Also, a single query may have several `OPTIONAL` clauses, which can be nested.</copy>
    ```

The query output is as shown:

    ### Query 9
    Query 9 finds names of writers and directors of movies with Carl Weathers.
    Note the use of nested graph patterns to identify the patterns that are part of the `UNION`.

    #### Matching Alternatives
    SPARQL provides a `UNION` clause to match one or more of several alternative patterns.</copy>

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 11
    Query 11 finds information about actors who have worked with more than 15 different directors. This query uses a subquery to find a small set of actors and then finds ms:name triples for only those actors.

    #### Subqueries
    SPARQL supports subqueries. A SPARQL `SELECT` query can be nested inside a graph pattern. Subqueries enable useful capabilities such as limiting the number of results returned from a part of the overall query.</copy>

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 12
    Query 12 finds the number of actors connected to Kevin Bacon within 4 co-star relations.

    ## Property Paths
    SPARQL property paths allow you to match aribtrary length paths when searching for connected resources in an RDF graph. The start and destination positions in a property path may be query variables or constant RDF terms, but only constant URIs are allowed in the path expression iself.
    Property paths use a regular expression style syntax to express path patterns. Some highlights of the syntax are shown below (see Section 9.1 of the SPARQL 1.1 specification for details of the syntax):
      - `elt*` - zero or more repetitions of `elt`
      - `elt+` - one or more repetitions of `elt`
      - `elt1/elt2` - elt1 followed by `elt2`
      - `elt1|elt2` - an alternate path of `elt1` or `elt2`
      - `^elt` - inverse path (object to subject)
      - `elt{m,n}` - between `m` and `n` repetitions of `elt`</copy>

    Query 15 builds a co-star graph using an ms:coStar relationship. In this case each solution returned from the `WHERE` clause generates three triples using bindings for `?actor1`, `?actor2`, `?name1`, and `?name2`.

    #### SPARQL CONSTRUCT
    SPARQL `CONSTRUCT` queries return an RDF graph built by inserting variable bindings into a construct template.</copy>
    ```

The query output is as shown:

2. Execute the following in an RDF paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%sparql-rdf

    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    PREFIX  xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
    PREFIX   ms: <http://www.example.com/moviestream/>

    CONSTRUCT { ?actor1 ms:coStar ?actor2 .
                  ?actor1 ms:name ?name1 .
                  ?actor2 ms:name ?name2 }
    WHERE { ?movie ms:actor ?actor1 .
              ?actor1 ms:name ?name1 .
              ?movie ms:actor ?actor2 .
              ?actor2 ms:name ?name2 .
              FILTER (!sameTerm(?actor1, ?actor2))
    }
    LIMIT 50 </copy>
    ```

Section 16:  Example Query 16: Using a SPARQL DESCRIBE Query

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 16
    Query 16 uses the simple form describes the resource ms:movie_1216.

    ## SPARQL DESCRIBE
    SPARQL `DESCRIBE` queries also return an RDF graph instead of a set of variable bindings. `DESCRIBE` queries return an RDF graph that describes the resources in a query result. The description of the resource includes any triples in which the resource appears in the subject or object position.</copy>
    ```

The query output is as shown:

  ![Uses the simple form describes the resource ms:movie_1216](./images/query16.png)

2. Execute the following in an RDF paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%sparql-rdf

    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    PREFIX  xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
    PREFIX   ms: <http://www.example.com/moviestream/>

    DESCRIBE ms:movie_1216</copy>
    ```

1. Execute the following in a Markdown paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%md
    ### Query 17
    Query 17 uses the `DESCRIBE WHERE` form to describe the director of Toy Story.</copy>

    ```

The query output is as shown:

  ![Uses the `DESCRIBE WHERE` form to describe the director of Toy Story](./images/query17.png)

2. Execute the following in an RDF paragraph.

    ```
    <copy>%sparql-rdf

    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

    PREFIX   ms: <http://www.example.com/moviestream/>

      DESCRIBE ?director
      WHERE {  
        ?movie ms:title "Toy Story" ;
        ms:director ?director
      } </copy>
    ```
